# Art On The Block

A fun **Discord bot** similar to the game Gartic Phone's Icebreaker mode, but in a "question of the day" format.<br>
It's a fun way to practice art and engage with your community!

The bot runs **events** where the participants **create artwork based on a prompt** and submit it to be shown at a defined date.<br>
Users may also create their own prompts to be used for the next event *(if the event repeats)*, making the prompts virtually endless!<br>
I plan to make it *really* **customizable**, and work for any art form. *(drawings, music, heck even games if you wanted too)*

This project is made with **node.js v18.12.1** with the **discord.js** library.

## Usage
Use **/create** in the channel you'd like to start an event in to begin!<br>
*Better setup instructions coming soon...*

## Installation
```
npm install
```

## Configuration
Create a **.env** file in root with the following property's.<br>
```ini 
TOKEN=<INSERT TOKEN HERE>
CLIENT_ID=<INSERT CLIENT ID HERE>
```
