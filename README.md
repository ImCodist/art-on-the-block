# Art On The Block

A fun **Discord bot** similar to the game Gartic Phone's Icebreaker mode, but in a "question of the day" format.

Originally created as a bot for the members of my discord server to use, and as a way of encouraging myself to draw more!

I thought the idea was neat and figured I'd make a **public version** for anyone to use and play around with.

This project is made with **node.js v18.12.1** with the **discord.js** library.
