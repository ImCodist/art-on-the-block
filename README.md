# Art On The Block

A fun **Discord bot** similar to the game Gartic Phone's Icebreaker mode, but in a "question of the day" format.<br>It's a fun way to practice art and engage with your community!

Originally created as a bot for the members of my discord server to use, and as a way of encouraging myself to draw more!<br>
I thought the idea was neat and figured I'd make a **public version** for anyone to use and play around with.

This project is made with **node.js v18.12.1** with the **discord.js** library.

## Usage
Use **/create** in the channel you'd like to start an event in to begin!<br>
*Better setup instructions coming soon...*

## Installation
```
npm install
```

## Configuration
Create a **.env** file in root with the following property's.<br>
```ini 
TOKEN=<INSERT TOKEN HERE>
CLIENT_ID=<INSERT CLIENT ID HERE>
```
